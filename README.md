> Material Design icons

**THIS PROJECT IS ARCHIVED**

An alternative website for Material Design icons primarily aimed at designers to quickly copy paste the svg code directly into their tools.

## Notes

Although Battery and Signal are present in the official Material Design website but they are removed from the official icon font. So it is unavailable right now until I implement the svgs myself instead of loading the icon font from Google stylesheet.
